            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I am currently a contractor for a B2B digital marketing agency out of San Diego. I was a full time social media manager for this company for 2.5 years before moving across the country. As I was preparing to move, I moved to a contact role with a greater focus on website projects, analytics, and ads. I enjoyed my work on website projects, so I decied to ebmark on learning front end web development.</p>
            <p>Before my San Diego role, I worked in marketing for 5.5 years for a high-end rug manufacturer our of Boston. The marketing work at this company involved both digital and physical/print media. Manufacturing for interior design is a form of a B2B industry, so I've been focused on B2B my whole career.</p>
            <p>I’d like to continue to work on web projects of increasing complexity. In my current role, I've been project managing websites. I have been able to use the new Front End skills that I learn through Treehouse in my actual work. In additon to other great coworkers, I've been fortunate enough to work alongside a senior developer and some other freelance developers who have helped me learn on the job.</p>
